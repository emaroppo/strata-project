"""The `[model] ref` contract — the seam a project plugs its model into.

Resolution itself lives in strata.modelling and is tested there: file and
module references, registry names, missing files and classes, the extra a
baseline needs. What this covers is the project's side of the seam alone:
a reference resolves against the project directory, ``[model.params]``
arrive as constructor arguments, and a failure reaches the caller as a
``ProjectError`` rather than as modelling's own exception.
